- For bigger problems you can write some pseudo code before the actual code.

PROCESS OF DEBUGGING
- Step 1: identify the bug. During development, software testing or production users report.
- Step 2: find the bug in the code.
- Step 3: fix the bug.
- Step 4: prevent similiar bugs from happening, by reviewing the codebase.
- There is an imbedded tool for debugging in the devtools, in sources tab.
