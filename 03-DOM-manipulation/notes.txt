DOM MANIPULATION OVERVIEW
- DOM (stands for document object model) can be described as a connection between JS and HTML/CSS. It's a structured representation of HTML documents, which allows us to access HTML/CSS elements and styles to manipulate them with JS code.
- DOM should be seen as a tree where each HTML element is a node, that is interlinked with it's parent element. The first element of the DOM tree is 'Document' which JS has access to.
- HTML element itself and its content are both separate nodes of the DOM tree. The element is a parent and it's content is a child.
- DOM methods and properties are NOT a part of JS. DOM is a so called web API (stands for application programming interface) which browsers include on their own.

SELECTING AND MANIPULATING ELEMENTS
- To select an HTML element in JavaScript file we use 
'document.querySelector()' method in which we pass a class or element name to get access to. Then we can extract the content of an element via different methods, for example, '.textContent' will give us text of the element.
- After selecting the element with 'querySelector' and using submethod to access it's property, we can then change it's value.
- I general JS programming is selecing an element, and assigning a new value to it when the certain condition is met.

HANDLING CLICK EVENTS
- Event is a user activity on the web-page. Then can be a press of a specific button on the page or scroll of the mouse ring. Most of the events have unique names.
- Event listener is a method that we can assign to the selected HTML element where the event will occur. When event listener triggers on specified event it will somehow change the current element or any other elements of the page.
- Event listener accepts the event name as a string as first argument, then it takes the function that will trigger when the event is happend.
- The function that event listener will use can be defined both inside the event listener arguments parentheses, or otside it. In second case you give its name as an argument, WITHOUT the ending parentheses.
- You can make each '.querySelector' ito a variable, to avoid writing the same code multiple times.
- When having an event that sould change multiple values of different HTML elements, make event listener function that will call other functions within itself.

IMPLEMENTING GAME LOGIC
- It's always better to store a value (f.e, score) in a variable (thеsе variables are called 'state variables')inside the JS script and then displaying it, rather than taking the value from the DOM, changing it in the script and then displaying it again.

MANIPULATING CSS STYLES
- To change the CSS styles via JS we simply add '.styles' to selected HTML element and the select the style we need. Example: 'document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor = '#fff'.
- When writing style names in CSS we write them in lower camel case instead od kebab case.
