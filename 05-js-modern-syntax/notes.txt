ARRAY DESTRUCTURING
- Destructuring is a feature, that allows to unpack values of an array in differrent variables. In general, this lets us break a complex data structure down in smaller pieces.
- To destructure an array we declare an array, then we declare the destructuring assignment, like this: 'const [a, b, c] = arr'. a, b and c will become the elements of an array, and we can freely use them, as if they were regular variables.
