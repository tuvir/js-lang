WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT
- JavaScript is high-level, object-oriented programming language that ismainly used for web-development.
- JavaScript gets updated every year. Current biggest update is 2015 version ES6.

LINKING A JAVASCRIPT FILE 
- When adding JS logic to the website we can directly include it into the HTML file, by adding <script> tag inside <head> and writing the code inside this tag. Thi method is called 'inline'. It is good for not including extra file, but it doesn't separate JS from HTML which is not wanted for clear code.
- We can make a separate file for JS code and then link it by adding an empty script tag at the end of the <body> and specifying the location of the script file using 'src' attribute. 

VALUES AND VARIABLES
- Value is a smallest piece of information. It can be a number, letter word or string of words. We can interract differently with values, for example, logging them into the console or use mathematical operations on them.
- The core value operation is assingnment, by which we can store a value inside the variable and have access to it.
- To declare a variable we use 'let' keyword after which we specify the variable name (written in lower camel case) and then we assign a value to the variable. Numerical value can be written as it is, text value is enclosed in quotes.
- A constant value, like PI number should have varaible named in all caps, like 'let PI' rather than 'let Pi'.
- Variable names should be descriptive, to make it easy to understand which value does it hold.

DATA TYPES
- in JavaScript there are two types of values - objects, which are values that have multiple values on it's own, and primitives, which hve only one specific value. There are seven primitives.
- Number. For both inegers and decimals. let age = 18;
- String. Sequence of characters, used for text. let firstName = 'petr';
- Boolean. Only 'true' or 'false', used for decision making. let fullAge = true;
- Undefined. Value of yet undefined variable. let children;
- Null. Means 'empty value'.
- Symbol (ES2015) - unique value that can't be changed.
- Bigint (ES2020) - Stores larger numbers than Number type can hold.
- JavaScript has dynamic typing, which means that you don't need to manually define the data type of a value which variable will store. Instead thge type is determined automatically.
- In JavaScript VALUES have the type, not VARIABLES.
- 'typeof' operator can be used to print the type value of a variable or just value as a string.
- To change the value of a variable, we simply assing it to the variable. We do not need to use 'let' keyword again.
- There is a JavaScript language bug, regarding typeof null. If we try to console.log typeof null, it will say that it's type is 'object', rather than 'null'.
